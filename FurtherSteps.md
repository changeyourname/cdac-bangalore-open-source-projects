# Gstreamer & WLAN Starting Points #

Video Synch between two panda boards Further steps involved.



1.  Bring up the pandaboard with Ubuntu along with all the necessary add-ons refer to omappedia.org.

2.      Test the working of WLAN between the two pandaboards by connecting them in adhoc mode or by making use of a router.

3.     Install gstreamer on one pandaboard. Gstreamer is a framework for creating streaming media application.

4.     Study in detail about gstreamer & get the procedure for installing gstreamer framework on the pandaboard.

5.     When you open a multimedia file on a media player, you should be able to broadcast it using gstreamer on the IP of WLAN such that our pandaboard is now acting as a wireless multimedia server.

6.     On the other board we need to receive it & play the same on the media player.

7. The bandwidth should be monitored using the Iperf tool.


For doing this the students should be good at programming the media player apart from gstreamer & they need to know how
the gstreamer can interact with WLAN.
